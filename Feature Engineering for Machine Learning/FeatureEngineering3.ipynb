Here,K=N/n known as sample interval.One unit be selected at randomly first,let it be i, then other sucessive sample are i+k,i+2k,....,i+(n-1)k.\n","This type of systematic sampling is known as linear systematic sampling.\n","- **(c)Stratified sampling:** In this technique, first the whole population is divided into homogeneous group under certain criterion.These group are called strata.Then the sample is drawn from each stratum.Proper care should be taken while making strata.\n","\n","\n","- **(d)Cluster Sampling:** The entire population is divided into the smallest unit.A group of such unit is known as cluster.When the sampling unit is cluster,the procedure is called cluster sampling and a whole cluster is randomly selected to be included in the study.\n","This type of sampling is used when we focus on a specific region or area.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6rCgDhzp0CY8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**(B)Non-Probability Sampling:**\n","The sample is selected on the basis of personal knowledge,opinion and discretion of the sampler.\n","- **(a)Convenience Sampling:**This is perhaps the easiest method of sampling because individuals are selected based on their availability and willingness to take part.\n","- **(b)Quota Sampling:**In this type of sampling, we choose items based on predetermined characteristics of the population. Consider that we have to select individuals having a number in multiples of five for our sample.\n","- **(c)Judgment Sampling:**It is also known as selective sampling. It depends on the judgment of the experts or researcher.\n","- **(d)Snowball Sampling:**This sampling method involves a primary data source nominating other potential data sources that will be able to participate in the research studies. Snowball sampling method is purely based on referrals and that is how a researcher is able to generate a sample. Therefore this method is also called the chain-referral sampling method.This method of sampling is effective when a sampling frame is difficult to identify.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C2cc05Yd5bxi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###**let’s obtain samples from a set of 10 products using probability sampling to determine the population

It is free, opensource, easy to use, large community, and well documented. NLTK consists of the most common algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition.Stopwords provides multiple sources of stopwords, for use in text analysis and natural language processing\n","\n","- **Stemming:**Stemming is also good practice as it involves reducing a word to its root form. For example Flying is a word and its suffix is ing, if we remove ing from Flying then we will get base word or root word which is “Fly”.\n","\n","- **Tokenization** is the process by which a large quantity of text is divided into smaller parts called tokens. These tokens are very useful for finding patterns and are considered as a base step for stemming.Tokenizers divide strings into lists of substrings.\n","\n","\n","- **Create a Vector:**\n","The next step is to create a vector of all the words.This is now tokenization which is the process of taking each of the words in the observations and making a column for each.**CountVectorizer** is a great tool provided by the scikit-learn library in Python. It is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text. This is helpful when we have multiple such texts, and we wish to convert each word in each text into vectors (for using in further text analysis).**CountVectorizer creates a matrix** in which each unique word is represented by a column of the matrix, and each text sample from the document is a row in the matrix. The value of each cell is nothing but the count of the word in that particular text sample.\n","\n","- **NOTE: For more details Project name: \"Text Classification and Clustering\".**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cwAdn_bvspy-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Model Selection in Machine Learning**\n","- Model selection refers to choose the best statistical machine learning model for a particular problem domain."],"metadata":{"id":"2-7AXOIZpyKm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**No Free Lunch Theorem:**\n","- According to the “No Free Lunch” theory, there is no such algorithm that works best on all the possible senarios.\n","\n","- We should focus of the problem, datset, the cost and other extra informations before choosing an algorithm.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"EWnjcQRjEpNA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**Techniques of Model Selection:**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"X9-XTk2SHiOM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###**(a)Resampling:**\n","- These are simple techniques just rearranging data samples and inspecting that the model performs good or bad with the data set.\n","- Some Resampling techniques are **Random Split,Time-Based Split,K-Fold Cross-Validation,Stratified K-Fold,Bootstrap etc.**\n","- **Random Splits** are used to randomly sample a percentage of data into training, testing, and preferably validation sets. The advantage of this method is that there is a good chance that the original population is well represented in all the three sets.\n","- In a Machine Learning algorithm we can split the given dataset into training and test data. We can either split randomly or use time based splitting.There are some types of data where random splits are not possible. For example, if we have to train a model for weather forecasting, we cannot randomly divide the data into training and testing sets. This will jumble up the seasonal pattern! Such data is often referred to by the term – **Time Series.**\n","\n","- The **cross-validation** technique works by randomly shuffling the dataset and then splitting it into k groups.\n","- The process for **stratified K-Fold** is similar to that of K-Fold cross-validation with one single point of difference – unlike in k-fold cross-validation, the values of the target variable is taken into consideration in stratified k-fold.\n","- **Bootstrap** is one of the most powerful ways to obtain a stabilized model.
